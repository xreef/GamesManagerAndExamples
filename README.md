A collection of manger for sound graphics and sprite in pure java to understand the world of 2d games.

They are created in pure java with minimal dependencies (logging lib), created from a guide of old book and restilized in some part. 

This is an old work. 

This is the base for the creation of Brukonoid and WormRedo.
